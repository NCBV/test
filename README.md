# PCBS Project by Nicolas Beauvais

I plan to do my PCBS project on coding and Implicit Association task, which aim is to determine the speed of association between items of two categories.
I do not know yet exactly what will be the two categories of my Implicit association task, but historical examples of such paradigms involve Valence (positive vs Negative) - Gender (Male vs Female) comparison, or also US origin(American vs Foreign)-Facial look (White vs Native american) comparison.
